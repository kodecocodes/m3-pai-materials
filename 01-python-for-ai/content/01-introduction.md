# Introduction

Welcome to _Introduction to Python and Jupyter Notebooks_! 

In this lesson, you’ll set up your computer with a programming environment that you can use to write Python applications in JupyterLab, the “computational notebook” environment that you’ll use throughout this course. Once the environment is set up, you’ll get a quick course to get you acquainted with JupyterLab and Python programming.

This lesson covers the following topics:

* Setting up an AI programming environment on your computer by installing Python and JupyterLab.
* Using a notebook in JupyterLab for interactive coding and documentation.
* Basic Python syntax, data types, and control structures.

JupyterLab is a web-based user interface for working with _computational notebooks_, which are interactive documents that combine code, text, images, and visualizations. JupyterLab’s computational notebooks — often referred to as “Jupyter notebooks” — are the preferred development environment for data science and AI development, with 80% of data scientists and AI developers using them regularly.

The Python programming language is known for its simplicity, consistency, readability, and flexibility. These qualities, combined with its vast collection of libraries, especially for data science and machine learning, have made it popular with data scientists and AI developers.

This lesson will cover a lot of ground, so let’s get started!
